# Scenarios
This directory should contain a set of scenarios that illustrate how the various messages in the Collaboration Protocol can be used. 

Each scenario should have its own subdirectory. Each scenario should be in markdown format, similar to this file. See here for directions on formatting markdown files: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html

Each scenario is put in its own subdirectory to allow users to include supporting diagrams if needed (this is strongly encouraged). A picture is worth a thousand words. This is equally true for sequence diagrams.
