# DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge Collaboration Protocol

## Introduction
This repository contains the Collaboration Protocol interface specification along with supporting documentation. 

## Repository Layout
The root of the repository contains the interface specification as a Google Protocol Buffer .proto file. It also contains the following subdirectories:

* **doc:** This contains any autogenerated documentation built from code in this repository
* **examples:** This contains runnable examples illustrating how to work with the Collaboration Protocol
* **scenarios:** This contains a series of scenarios showing the ways in which the messages in the Collaboration Protocol may be used. Any time new messages or data types are added to the Collaboration Protocol, there should be a new scenario added in its own subdirectory to illustrate how and why the new messages would be useful. Diagrams are encouraged.
